# remdata

Update to the excellent wxremdata command line tool (http://people.duke.edu/~dgraham/wxRemind/) to clean up the code and pare down to just the essential command line display functions.
Minimal sets of dependencies, but requires remind (https://www.roaringpenguin.com/wiki/index.php/Remind) to run.
